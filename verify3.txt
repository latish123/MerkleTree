Your father is like your true friend. You always receive so much love and affection from him. He looks after you and cares for 
you like no other. Your father will always be strict with you because he wants the best for you.
It is because he loves you that he wants you to be a good person with all the good values and 
high morals. You share a very special bond with your father. Try to reciprocate the love he has 
for you. You can never repay a father for all that he does for you but you can definitely show 
your love and care for him.
