An ecosystem is balanced when the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living)
parts of the ecosystem are in equilibrium. This means that the 
nutrients are able to cycle efficiently, and no community of organisms or 
natural phenomena is interrupting the flow of energy and nutrients to 
other parts of the ecosystem.
